# Minimal gulp setup for sketching

This is my prototyping gulp setup for working with foundation and wordpress. 

### Install

- npm Install
- gulp watch

### Foundation SCSS

- normalize 
- only the responsive modules are imported by default (grid, visibility)

### app.js 

- body class based javascript scope. 
- jquery and foundation.js added by default. 
- scripts can be added or removed through gulpfile.js
